### Hi there 👋


My name is Sebastian and I am a developer and data analyst.

I like using the MERN Stack and such I am using NodeJS, Express and MongoDB for the backend and React or plain JS for the frontend. Data.wise I like using Python and SQL.

I am a self thaught developer who started coding in 2019. After completing some online courses (@CodingNomads, Jonas Schmedtmann@Udemy) I applied for a conversion Master in Data Engineering at Edinburgh Napier University. I like working with databases, large sets  of data and getting insights about it rather than being a designer. Working on the backend to get the desired data is therefore a prerequesite. Previous to shifting careers I worked as an Auditor (Finance & IT) and studied business management as an undergraduate degree.

Here are some quick facts about myself and my work:

- 🔭 I’m currently working on creating some of my own API's and just got the Google Analytics Certification

- 🌱 I’m currently learning about MERN full stack development with [Brad Traversy](https://www.traversymedia.com/) and [Jonas Schmedtman](http://jonas.io/)

- 🤔 I’m always looking to learn new skills

- 💬 Ask me about interesting projects & every sport you can imagine (I even watch curling sometimes)


Thanks for looking at my profile and I might talk to you soon!
