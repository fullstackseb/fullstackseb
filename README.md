### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


My name is Sebastian and I am a Developer. I like to work with JavaScript and React. I mostly use Tailwind CSS and daisy UI for the frontend.
For the backend I work my way towards Node.js and MongoDB to work full stack with the MERN Stack.

I have built some projects and they are public repos, so please feel free to have a look at them. I am a self thaught developer who started coding in 2019. After completing some online courses (@CodingNomads, Udemy) I applied for a conversion Master in Data Engineering at Edinburgh Napier University where I also spent one year during my undergraduate degree. I like the logical side of programming and databases rather than being a designer. I also like the overview and the big picture of projects. That's why I am focussing on fullstack work instead of specialising in front or backend technology. Previous to shifting careers I worked as an Auditor (Finance & IT) and studied business management as an undergraduate degree.

Here are some quick facts about myself and my work:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on creating my personal Trello clone with React
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Node.js and MongoDB
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m always looking to learn new skills

- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about interesting projects & every sport you can imagine

- âš¡ Fun fact: I like to get up early and I can't get used to the feeling that you sometimes just feel 'dumb' as a developer


Thanks for looking at my profile and I might talk to you soon!
