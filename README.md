### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


My name is Sebastian and I am a Web Developer. I like to work with JavaScript. I mostly use React for the frontend
and NodeJS and Express for the backend to work full stack with the MERN Stack.

I am a self thaught developer who started coding in 2019. After completing some online courses (@CodingNomads, Udemy) I applied for a conversion Master in Data Engineering at Edinburgh Napier University. I like the logical side of programming and databases rather than being a designer. Previous to shifting careers I worked as an Auditor (Finance & IT) and studied business management as an undergraduate degree.

Here are some quick facts about myself and my work:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on creating my own typing speed measurement website with own API
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Web3 with [LearnWeb3DAO](https://learnweb3.io) and I use Linux (Ubuntu) on a daily basis
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m always looking to learn new skills

- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about interesting projects & every sport you can imagine (I even watch curling sometimes)

- âš¡ Fun fact: I like to get up early and I can't get used to the feeling that you sometimes just feel 'dumb' as a developer


Thanks for looking at my profile and I might talk to you soon!
