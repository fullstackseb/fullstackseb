### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


My name is Sebastian and I am a developer. 

I like to work with JavaScript. I mostly use React for the Frontend
and NodeJS with Express for the Backend to work use the MERN Stack entirely.

I am a self thaught developer who started coding in 2019. After completing some online courses (@CodingNomads, Jonas Schmedtmann@Udemy) I applied for a conversion Master in Data Engineering at Edinburgh Napier University. I like the logical side of programming and databases rather than being a designer. Previous to shifting careers I worked as an Auditor (Finance & IT) and studied business management as an undergraduate degree.

Here are some quick facts about myself and my work:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on creating some of my own API's with Frontend (typing speed, travel planner, password checker)
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning more about MERN full stack development with (Brad Traversy)[https://www.traversymedia.com/] and (Jonas Schmedtmann)[http://jonas.io/] and I use Linux (Ubuntu) on a daily basis
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m always looking to learn new skills 

- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about interesting projects & every sport you can imagine (I even watch curling sometimes)

- âš¡ Fun fact: I like to get up early and I can't get used to the feeling that you sometimes just feel 'dumb' as a developer


Thanks for looking at my profile and I might talk to you soon!
