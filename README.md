### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


My name is Sebastian and I currently work as an IT-Auditor in Frankfurt, Germany.

I like working on problems and do all sorts of database, backend and Linux things. I use Django with Python and PostgreSQL/MySQL to work as a Backend Developer. I also use Javascript and React to get a better understanding of Full Stack Development.

I am a self thaught developer who started coding in 2019. After completing some online courses, I applied for a conversion Master in Data Engineering at Edinburgh Napier University where I was one of the first students to finish the course. I like working with databases, the command line and the architectural side of things rather than designing nice looking Frontends.

Here are some quick facts about myself and my work:

- ðŸ”­ I currently work in IT-Audit

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m very much interested in different possibilities for Backend development

- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m always looking to learn new skills and like to solve problems

- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about interesting projects & every sport you can imagine (I even watch curling during winter times)


Thanks for looking at my profile and I might talk to you soon!
