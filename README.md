### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


My name is Sebastian and I am an auditor and data analyst.

I like using Python and SQL and do all sorts of data analysis and database things. I played around a little bit with the MERN Stack to learn JavaScript and NodeJS and get a better understanding of Full Stack Web Development.

I am a self thaught developer who started coding in 2019. After completing some online courses (@CodingNomads) I applied for a conversion Master in Data Engineering at Edinburgh Napier University. I like working with databases, large sets  of data and getting insights about it especially for business related problems. Previous to shifting careers I worked as an Auditor (Finance & IT) and studied business management as an undergraduate degree.

Here are some quick facts about myself and my work:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on IT Audit & Information Security (ISO 27001, NIST Framework, OSCP)

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m very much interested in Data Analytics and Deep Learning in combination with Penetration Testing and Information Security. Cloud & IoT Security being a special interest of mine (especially smart homes!)

- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m always looking to learn new skills

- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about interesting projects & every sport you can imagine (I even watch curling in winter times)


Thanks for looking at my profile and I might talk to you soon!
