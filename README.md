### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


My name is Sebastian and I am a Developer. I like to work with JavaScript and React. I mostly use Tailwind CSS and daisy UI for the frontend.
For the backend I work my way towards Node.js and MongoDB to work full stack with the MERN Stack.

I have built some projects and they are public repos, so please feel free to have a look at them. I am a self thaught developer who started coding in 2019. After completing some online courses (@ CodingNomads) I applied for a conversion Master in Data Engineering at Edinburgh Napier University where I also spent one year during my undergraduate degree. I like the logical side of programming and databases rather than being a good web designer. I also like the overview and the big picture of projects why I am focussing on fullstack work rather than specialising in front or backend technology. Previous to shifting careers I worked as an financial auditor and studied business management as an undergraduate degree.

Here are some quick facts about myself and my work:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on creating more projects with React (currently a quiz app)
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Node.js and MongoDB
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m always looking to learn new skills

- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about interesting projects & every sport you can imagine

- âš¡ Fun fact: I really struggle to think I am 'real' developer


Thanks for being at my profile and I might see you soon! :)
