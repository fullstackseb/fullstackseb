### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


My name is Sebastian and I am a developer. 

I like using the MERN Stack and such I am using NodeJS, Express and MongoDB for the backend and React for the frontend.

I am a self thaught developer who started coding in 2019. After completing some online courses (@CodingNomads, Jonas Schmedtmann@Udemy) I applied for a conversion Master in Data Engineering at Edinburgh Napier University. I like the logical side of programming and databases rather than being a designer. Previous to shifting careers I worked as an Auditor (Finance & IT) and studied business management as an undergraduate degree.

Here are some quick facts about myself and my work:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on creating some of my own API's with Frontend (typing speed, travel planner, password checker)

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about MERN full stack development with [Brad Traversy](https://www.traversymedia.com/) and [Jonas Schmedtman](http://jonas.io/) and the AWS Cloud

- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m always looking to learn new skills and want to contribute to Open Source more

- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about interesting projects & every sport you can imagine (I even watch curling sometimes)


Thanks for looking at my profile and I might talk to you soon!
